# 2d-SPH-fluid-sim-in-javscript
I implemented a 2d fluid simulation in javascript using a particle based approach treating each particle as an individual volume of water with a specific fixed influence zone around each particle which gets smoothed out over distance allowing for realistic fluid like flows!
